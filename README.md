# AI Collaborated With Me

![Screen Shot](/screenshot.png)

This project was created (in collaboration with AI) to encourage professionals who use AI in their content creation process to be more transparent about it. The landing page in this repo is currently hosted for public use at [ai.collaboratedwith.me](https://ai.collaboratedwith.me), but you are free to customize the page and host it yourself.

## How to Use

Simply include the declaration below (or some variation of it) whenever publishing content created with or by AI:

**Examples:**

Plain Text:
```
Transparency Declaration: ai.collaboratedwith.me
```

Markdown:

```markdown
Transparency Declaration: [ai.collaboratedwith.me](https://ai.collaboratedwith.me)
```

HTML:

```html
Transparency Declaration: <a href="https://ai.collaboratedwith.me">ai.collaboratedwith.me</a>
```

## Self-Hosted Option

Simply publish the `index.html` file on any server.
